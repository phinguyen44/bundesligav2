# bundesligav2
V2 of /bundesliga - now includes more metrics and statistics on the league for 2014-2015.

The primary difference is there is now a "metric selector" which allows you to chose a metric to view data. For example, if you're curious to see the goal differential over the course of the league for each time, you can select to view the data for that metric.
